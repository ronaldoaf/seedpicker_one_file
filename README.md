# SeedPicker 

Same application as the url https://seedpicker.net/calculator/last-word.html

The .js and .css files were merged into the .htm file

Removed a few unnecessary codes

**Don't trust, check.**

I made a page to use on an old cell phone that doesn't access the internet. I sent the page via bluetooth
